Math::Project3D::Plot
=====================

INTRODUCTION

This module uses Math::Project3D to project an arbitrary
three dimensional function onto a plane and then plots the
outcome into an Imager image.

Detailed documentation can be found as pod in the module file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   pray

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Imager 0.41 or newer
  Math::MatrixReal 1.9 or newer
  Math::Project3D 1.02 or newer
  Test::More 0.44 or newer

Note that it may well work with older versions of these modules,
but I cannot guarantee that it will because I only tested it with
the versions listed.
Since v1.020 of this module, it will no longer work with versions
of Math::Project3D prior to 1.02. You should be able to find
previous releases of this module in case you do not have the newest
Math::Project3D available. Please look at the Changes file for
details on what you'll be missing.
