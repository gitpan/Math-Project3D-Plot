Math::Project3D::Plot version 1.005
===================================

INTRODUCTION

This module uses Math::Project3D to project an arbitrary
three dimensional function onto a plane and then plots the
outcome into an Imager image.

Detailed documentation can be found as pod in the module file.

   perl Makefile.PL

Note that it may well work with older versions of these modules,
